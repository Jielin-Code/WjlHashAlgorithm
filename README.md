# WjlHashAlgorithm
Wang Jielin Hash algorithm(WJLHA) is a brand-new Hash algorithm created by utilizing the weighted probability model function. This function can encode an input message string of any length into an output string of any(in a proper range) length. The algorithm has not found the same hash value in the experiment. It can be used iteratively and the length of the output can be customized. The algorithm can be applied flexibly and suit for digital signatures, file verification, collision technology, etc.
